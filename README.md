# NPS - National Parks with COVID-19 updates! 

Web application that allows users to find national parks and any alerts primarily related to COVID-19 from the NPS API . 

On the home page users of the site users can either create an account or log in to their account. The site will fully authenticate users.

Users are not required to log into the site to view parks or alert. With that being said, the top of the home page users will find links to Parks in the database, alerts for all parks, photos of natioonal parks from the NPS facebook site, and the nps.gov homepage. The parks links shows all National Parks in the database and allows users to add new parks, users can click on each park to learn more about the park itself. The show page shows all information about the park, allows users to update the park information, click on alerts to see if the park has any closures or imformation.  Future implementations of this project would allow users to save the park to their profile.

The free and public API utilized, https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm, has a massive amount information. For this project, I had the idea of users coming to the site to get information about a park and any alerts about the park during this time unprecendented time. 

This project was created for Module 3 of the Immersive Software Engineering Program at the Flatiron School.
